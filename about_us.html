            <p class='indent'>Every true "foodie" worth their salt knows that some of the best food in any city can be found on food trucks - but knowing when and where those trucks <hr> will be can be next to impossible, and discovering new ones often relies on word-of-mouth that is long on tales of delicious, but short on actual details. FoodTruck TrackR was designed to make finding and eating at a food truck fast, easy and fun.  Quickly see all of our Operator partners' nearby food trucks that are <hr> currently open, view their current real-time GPS location, know the scheduled arrival and departure times, view photos, read customer reviews and much more, all in our easy to use app.</p>
