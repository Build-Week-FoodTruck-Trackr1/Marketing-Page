            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Every true "foodie" worth their salt knows that some of the best food in any city can be found on food trucks - but knowing when and where those trucks will be can be next to impossible, and discovering new ones often relies on word-of-mouth that is long on tales of delicious, but short on actual details.</p>

            <p>FoodTruck TrackR was designed to make finding and eating at a food truck fast, easy and fun.  Quickly see all of our Operator partners' nearby food trucks that are currently open, view their current real-time GPS location, know the scheduled arrival and departure times, view photos, read customer reviews and much more, all in our easy to use app.</p>
